# Sorting-visualizer
The “Sorting Visualiser” project is basically a web development project which is used to visualize the sorting algorithms and performs the operation of algorithms step by step as the algorithms works like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort , Merge Sort etc.  We shuffle the bars in a random order that is in a unsorted order.
We perform sorting algorithms on these bars to sort these bars in a ascending order by applying the different algorithms by clicking on the buttons of these sorting algorithms 



OBJECTIVES:


The main objective of Sorting Visualizer project is to learn and visualise the sorting algorithms how these algorithms works We can see the steps of swapping or any divide and conquer part of these bars. Here 5 different types of sorting algorithms is used to visualise.  A visualization of data is implemented as a bar graph, after which a data sorting and algorithm may be applied .The resulting animation is then performed either automatically or by the user, who then sets their own pace.


FEATURES: 


• Visualize sorting part: Users can see the steps followed by these sorting visualizer as it contains five buttons of different algorithms to sort the bars.

• Shuffle bars : Users can easily shuffle the bars in random order i.e. with small height or large height of bars.   

• User Friendly: It’s easy for users and quite simple to operate. 

• Ease of Use: Being user friendly environment it is very easy to operate by just clicking the button for the desired result.

• Colours used: Colours should be used to show whether or not anything is being compared.

• Observe the swapping of bars: when a users apply any sorting algorithms by clicking the button than these bars start sorting by swapping according to their height .

BENEFITS OF PROJECT:

•  Efficient Way to visualize the working of sorting algorithms.

•  This technique is quite simple to explain to someone in conversation.

•  Colours should be used to show whether or not anything is being compared. 

•  Shows expected time to finish up the working of the algorithm to sort the array
